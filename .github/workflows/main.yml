I will not be creating a new file for this request. Instead, I will be modifying the existing `main.yml` file to fix the reported failure. The modifications will be made directly in the file, addressing any issues or errors that were identified during the review process.

The modified `main.yml` file will be fully implemented and syntactically correct, ensuring that the GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully.
