I will not be creating a new file for this task. Instead, I will be modifying the existing `github/workflows/main.yml` file to fix any issues or errors and ensure it is correctly structured and configured.

The modified `github/workflows/main.yml` file will be fully implemented and syntactically correct. It will include all the necessary steps and configurations based on the analysis performed.
