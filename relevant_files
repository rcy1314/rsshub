## Deploying with Helm CLI

To deploy RSSHub using Helm CLI, follow these steps:

1. Install Helm CLI if you haven't already. Refer to the [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for installation instructions.

2. Add the NaturalSelection Labs chart repository to Helm:

   ```bash
   helm repo add nsl https://naturalselectionlabs.github.io/helm-charts
   ```

3. Update the chart repository:

   ```bash
   helm repo update
   ```

4. Install RSSHub using the Helm CLI:

   ```bash
   helm install my-release nsl/rsshub \
     --set="image.tag=2023-12-04" \
     --set="replicaCount=2"
   ```

   Replace `my-release` with the desired release name. You can customize other values as needed.

5. Wait for the deployment to complete. You can check the status using the following command:

   ```bash
   helm status my-release
   ```

   Replace `my-release` with the release name used in the previous step.

6. Once the deployment is successful, you can access RSSHub using the configured URL.

   ```bash
   http://<your-rsshub-url>
   ```

   Replace `<your-rsshub-url>` with the URL configured for your RSSHub deployment.

7. To update the RSSHub deployment, use the following command:

   ```bash
   helm upgrade my-release nsl/rsshub
   ```

   Replace `my-release` with the release name used in the previous steps.

8. To uninstall the RSSHub deployment, use the following command:

   ```bash
   helm uninstall my-release
   ```

   Replace `my-release` with the release name used in the previous steps.
